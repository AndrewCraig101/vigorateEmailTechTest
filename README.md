# vigorateEmailTechTest

Hi thank you for inviting me to take the email test! I just wanted to add a few notes.

I used media queries to snap the tables into column for mobile. I'm researching how to use inline code only.

My font awesome account didn't give me access to the original social icons, I hope that's ok.

Cheers!
